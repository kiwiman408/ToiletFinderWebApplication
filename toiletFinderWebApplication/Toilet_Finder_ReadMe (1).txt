What works: 
*Front end is functional
*Some Java database logic classes still work with .csv files


What does not work:
*Backend does not work or is not present
*JSP not properly setup so front end files are still htmls
*SQL was never implemented failed to get a SQL made or hosted properly


Other issues:
* Html was written in a different IDE before being imported to eclipse so pictures are broken attempted fix but paths provided by eclispe do not work and altnerative do not work. Maybe an issue with where the asset directory itself is found
* Some of the csvs may or may not be included in a different directory
* Resolution of window messes with button layout
